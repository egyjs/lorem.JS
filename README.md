# What is Lorem.js

## What is "Lorem"?

Lorem ipsum is a name for a common type of placeholder text. Also known as filler or dummy text, this is simply copy that serves to fill a space without actually saying anything meaningful. Itâ€™s essentially nonsense text, but gives an idea of what real text will look like in the final product.

The best way to discover **Lorem.js** is to try it out:

{% page-ref page="getting-started.md" %}
